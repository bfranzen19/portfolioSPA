          <li><a href="https://btfranzen.com" target="_blank">www.btfranzen.com</a> (this site) - this is a single page application (SPA) that i created as a personal portfolio. this SPA utilizes vue router, custom components, as well as javascript, HTML, CSS, bootstrap, and expressjs.</li><br/>
          <li><a href="https://triggeraware.com" target="_blank">www.triggeraware.com</a> - this database allows you to search by tv/movie title or trigger type to ascertain whether or not there is a risk for you or another survivor to be triggered. users can also fill out a form to recommend triggering scenes to add to the database. this application was built as my final project at CodeCraft and was built using web scraping (cheerio and request), javascript, mongoDB (using mongoose to validate data), express, fuze.js (fuzzy search JS library), bootstrap 4, CSS, HTML, bcrypt for authentication to login and verify the recommended scenes from users.</li><br/>
          <li><a href="https://40northography.com" target="_blank">www.40northography.com</a> - i created this site, originally, as a photography portfolio but then utilized it as a way of allowing people to follow me on a month-long european backpacking trip to 13 different countries (if you count the freetown christiania in copenhagen) without needing to have membership to any social media. it allowed friends and family to know that we were safe, see some pictures, see maps of where we explored in each location (using my GPS watch), and hear a daily paragraph about our travels. it also allowed me to continue coding, maintain a website, and showcase photographs.</li><br/>
          <li><a href="https://piratefabricator.com" target="_blank">www.piratefabricator.com</a> - this is a simple landing page for a client who is a welder and carpenter. i designed and created the logo using adobe photoshop. </li>
